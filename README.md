# AONE WebRTC SFU Demo

`aone-webrtc-sfu` is a demo project designed to validate and showcase the core architecture of a WebRTC-based SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) server.

---

## üéØ Project Goals

- Share technical insights into a custom-designed SFU server built on Google WebRTC Native C++
- Demonstrate key modules including RTP forwarding, simulcast handling, and TWCC-based congestion control
- Provide a working demo environment with an Android WebRTC client app
- Explore potential real-world applications such as real-time broadcasting and IoT-based AR synchronization

---

## üì¶ Project Modules

- `media_server/`  
  - A minimal test server with built-in signaling and RTP relay features  
  - **Signaling is embedded** for development and testing convenience. In production, separating signaling into a standalone server is highly recommended

- `rtc_peerconnection/`  
  - A lightweight, customized PeerConnection module based on Google WebRTC Native code  
  - Optimized for core functionality: simulcast, TWCC, RID, RTP/RTCP handling  
  - **Source code is not publicly available**; structural overview only

- `android_client/`  
  - Source code for an Android WebRTC client app is included for demo testing

## üß© Technical Highlights

- **Lightweight PeerConnection Module**  
  Custom-modified from Google WebRTC Native for server-side performance and modular integration

- **Simulcast with RID-Based Layer Routing**  
  Handles multiple resolution layers from the sender using RID (RTP Stream ID)

- **Efficient RTP Forwarding & RTCP Feedback Processing**

- **TWCC-Based Congestion Control**  
  Implements server-side congestion control using Google‚Äôs TWCC algorithm for adaptive bandwidth handling

- **Built-in Signaling Architecture**  
  WebSocket-based signaling is included in the `media_server` for faster iteration during development.  
  This should be decoupled in real-world deployment.

## üìå Notes

- This repository is not a complete commercial-grade SFU server, but a **demo project for technical validation and concept sharing**
- For production use, additional components such as a standalone signaling server, TURN server integration, and security features are required
